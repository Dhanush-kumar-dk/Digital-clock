# Digital-clock 
<link href="https://resplendent-flan-93bf88.netlify.app/" alt="link"/>
A digital clock is a real-time display of the current time using digital numbers.<br>
It is a simple yet effective project to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br>
The goal of this project is to create a fully functioning digital clock that updates in real-time, displaying hours, minutes, and seconds, and refreshes automatically every second
#Components of the project

HTML (Structure)

1.HTML is used to create the basic structure of the digital clock.<br>
2.The clock will consist of a div element that will display the time.<br>
3.Each section (hours, minutes, seconds) will be wrapped in specific HTML elements (such as span) to make styling and manipulation easy.<br>

CSS (Styling)   <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=css" height="40" alt="css">  <img width="12" /><br>

1.CSS is used to design the appearance of the digital clock.<br>
2.You can style the clock's background, font size, color, alignment, and more.<br>
3.CSS animations can be added to create smooth transitions (optional).<br>

JavaScript (Functionality)  <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/javascript/javascript-original.svg" height="40" alt="javascript logo"  />

1.JavaScript is used to update the time in real-time.<br>
2.It grabs the current time using the Date object and updates the content of the clock every second using setInterval().<br>
3.The setInterval() function will ensure that the time is refreshed every second.<br>
