# Digital-clock
A digital clock is a real-time display of the current time using digital numbers. It is a simple yet effective project to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this project is to create a fully functioning digital clock that updates in real-time, displaying hours, minutes, and seconds, and refreshes automatically every second
#Components of the project

#HTML (Structure)

1.HTML is used to create the basic structure of the digital clock.
2.The clock will consist of a div element that will display the time.
3.Each section (hours, minutes, seconds) will be wrapped in specific HTML elements (such as span) to make styling and manipulation easy.

#CSS (Styling)

1.CSS is used to design the appearance of the digital clock.<br>
2.You can style the clock's background, font size, color, alignment, and more.
3.CSS animations can be added to create smooth transitions (optional).

#JavaScript (Functionality)

  <img width="12" />
1.JavaScript is used to update the time in real-time.
2.It grabs the current time using the Date object and updates the content of the clock every second using setInterval().
3.The setInterval() function will ensure that the time is refreshed every second.
